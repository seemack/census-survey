<h1>Census Survey</h1>

<div>
	<p>	Please answer the questions as completely as you are able. </p>
	<p>I believe every site that has implemented the Census area is able to track addresses over time. If this is not true, please disabuse me of that notion in the first section.</p>
	<p>If the answers to particular questions are complicated, you have questions about the question, or there's just more to add, please write as much as you like in the Comments sections. I'm especially interested in understanding what the barriers would be to making these changes.</p>
